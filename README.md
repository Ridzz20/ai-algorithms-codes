# AI Algorithms Codes

## 1. Implementation of tic-tac-toe game with single player.

Variation of minimax algorithm is used to play the game. AI chooses next possible winning position of board and thus drawing or winning the game.

## 2. Implementation of tic-tac-toe tree.

All valid board positions of tic-tac-toe game are discovered through constructing tree.

## 3. Implementation of A* algorithm.

Given graph and heuristics, this algorithm calculates best possible path from source to destination.

## 4. Implementation of Beam search.

Given 2 sat problem and beam width, this search can give the feasibility of finding solution.

## 5. Implementation of AO* algorithm.

Given a AND OR graph, AO* algorithms gives minimum cost for the graph

## Notes

These codes are not perfect... But can give you idea how respective algorithms works. Use your imagination and write your own code from scratch.
